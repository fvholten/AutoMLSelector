1. Title: Chess End-Game -- King+Rook versus King+Pawn on a7
(usually abbreviated KRKPA7). The pawn on a7 means it is one square
away from queening. It is the King+Rook's side (white) to move.

4. Relevant Information:
The dataset format is described below. Note: the format of this
database was modified on 2/26/90 to conform with the format of all
the other databases in the UCI repository of machine learning databases.

5. Number of Instances: 3196 total

6. Number of Attributes: 36

7. Attribute Summaries:
Classes (2): -- White-can-win (""won"") and White-cannot-win (""nowin"").
I believe that White is deemed to be unable to win if the Black pawn
can safely advance.
Attributes: see Shapiro's book.

8. Missing Attributes: -- none

9. Class Distribution:
In 1669 of the positions (52%), White can win.
In 1527 of the positions (48%), White cannot win.

The format for instances in this database is a sequence of 37 attribute values.
Each instance is a board-descriptions for this chess endgame. The first
36 attributes describe the board. The last (37th) attribute is the
classification: ""win"" or ""nowin"". There are 0 missing values.
A typical board-description is

f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,l,f,n,f,f,t,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,t,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,t,t,n,won

The names of the features do not appear in the board-descriptions.
Instead, each feature correponds to a particular position in the
feature-value list. For example, the head of this list is the value
for the feature ""bkblk"". The following is the list of features, in
the order in which their values appear in the feature-value list:

[bkblk,bknwy,bkon8,bkona,bkspr,bkxbq,bkxcr,bkxwp,blxwp,bxqsq,cntxt,dsopp,dwipd,

1. TITLE: 
  Letter Image Recognition Data 
 
    The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white
    rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English
    alphabet.  The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each
    letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of
    20,000 unique stimuli.  Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive
    numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then
    scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.  We
    typically train on the first 16000 items and then use the resulting model
    to predict the letter category for the remaining 4000.  See the article
    cited above for more details.","0.04090204510225511","0.9425298055650914","0.15215","0.841756863867533","0.9425298055650914","0.15215","0.841756863867533","0.9425298055650914","0.15215","0.841756863867533","4.69981072657316","0.6574545268026781","0.9293","0.03276976655404448","0.00085","nan","0.9379676053125593","0.15865","0.8349979241615618","0.9379676053125593","0.15865","0.8349979241615618","0.9379676053125593","0.15865","0.8349979241615618","4.0649999999999995","813.0","nan","2.075245046157538","8.338849999999995","nan","26.0","1.1599750154235924","3.304555303560269","nan","0.6977379005298701","5.925465624999998","nan","nan","26.0","0.29029703410184804","2.273771145446362","nan","-0.4211788221168451","3.046099999999995","nan","26.0","-0.31007906987268463","1.5467224363199539","3.6700000000000004","734.0","0.9559207236903551","0.36025","0.6253250509940796","0.0","26.0","17.0","20000.0","0.0","0.0","16.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","94.11764705882352","5.88235294117647","nan","0.3091324958538607","4.174812499999999","nan","-0.13733042812365298","2.017438812826727","nan","0.8853044390128566","5.913225000000001","nan","0.2543345879398813","2.2933721022270195","nan","1.1728389823381402","7.7260124999999995","nan","0.653378002627639","2.5474231354919117","0.9544303249787935","0.20315","0.7887152321892192","0.9544303249787935","0.20315","0.7887152321892192","0.9544303249787935","0.20315","0.7887152321892192","0.9080139521161272","0.1769","0.816017080292","0.9080139521161272","0.1769","0.816017080292","0.9080139521161272","0.1769","0.816017080292","0.0","0.9731018928391187","0.05785","0.939833878217649"

**Balance Scale Weight & Distance Database**  
This data set was generated to model psychological experimental results.  Each example is classified as having the balance scale tip to the right, tip to the left, or be balanced. The attributes are the left weight, the left distance, the right weight, and the right distance. The correct way to find the class is the greater of (left-distance * left-weight) and (right-distance * right-weight). If they are equal, it is balanced.

### Attribute description  
The attributes are the left weight, the left distance, the right weight, and the right distance.

**Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set.** Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target feature records the prognosis (malignant or benign). [Original data available here](ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/cancer/)  

Current dataset was adapted to ARFF format from the UCI version. Sample code ID's were removed.

**Multiple Features Dataset: Morphological**  
One of a set of 6 datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (0 - 9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. 200 instances per class (for a total of 2,000 instances) have been digitized in binary images. 

In this dataset, these digits are represented in terms of 6 morphological features. 

### Attribute Information  
The meaning of the features is mostly unknown. They are never named in the original files, and the paper only talks about 'morphological features, such as the number of endpoints'.

**Multiple Features Dataset: Pixel**  
One of a set of 6 datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (0 - 9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. The maps were scanned in 8 bit grey value at density of 400dpi, scanned, sharpened, and thresholded. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. 200 instances per class (for a total of 2,000 instances) have been digitized in binary images.  

Using this dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained (15 x 16 pixels).  

### Attribute Information  
The mfeatures represent 240 (15 x 16) pixel averages in 2 x 3 windows.

**Car Evaluation Database**  
This database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).

The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:
 
    CAR                      car acceptability
    . PRICE                  overall price
    . . buying               buying price
    . . maint                price of the maintenance
    . TECH                   technical characteristics
    . . COMFORT              comfort
    . . . doors              number of doors
    . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
    . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
    . . safety               estimated safety of the car
 
Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for
these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).
 
The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety. Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

**Multiple Features Dataset: Zernike**  
One of a set of 6 datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (0 - 9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. 200 instances per class (for a total of 2,000 instances) have been digitized in binary images. 

In this dataset, these digits are represented in terms of 47 Zernike moments. 

### Attribute Information  
The attributes represent 47 rotation invariant Zernike moments. They can't distinguish samples of class '6' from those of class '9'. More information on Zernike moments can be found in:

 4. Relevant Information:
    This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive
    Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not 
    pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview. The 
    problem is to predict the current contraceptive method choice 
    (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods) of a woman based 
    on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics.

### Dataset description

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

 4. Relevant Information:
  We used preprocessing programs made available by NIST to extract
  normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From
  a total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different
  13 to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping 
  blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block.
  This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an 
  integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives 
  invariance to small distortions.

  The way we used the dataset was to use half of training for 
  actual training, one-fourth for validation and one-fourth
  for writer-dependent testing. The test set was used for 
  writer-independent testing and is the actual quality measure.

**German Credit dataset**  
This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks.

This dataset comes with a cost matrix: 
``` 
Good  Bad (predicted)  
Good   0    1   (actual)  
Bad    5    0  
```

It is worse to class a customer as good when they are bad (5), than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good (1).

**Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits**  
We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers. The samples, written by 30 writers, are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.

We use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet
sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. 
 
These writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this. 
 
In our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.  

### Attribute information  

In order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time.
 
So, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity.
 
The way we used the dataset was to use first half of training for actual training, one-fourth for validation and one-fourth for writer-dependent testing. The test set was used for writer-independent testing and is the actual quality measure.","0.10290237467018469","0.9782711762062135","0.05058224163027657","0.9437860838946031","0.9782711762062135","0.05058224163027657","0.9437860838946031","0.9782711762062135","0.05058224163027657","0.9437860838946031","3.320771738890595","0.7173373091264319","0.7958515283842795","0.11176167822865958","0.0015465793304221252","nan","0.9817749787965896","0.04439592430858806","0.9506616486549189","0.9817749787965896","0.04439592430858806","0.9506616486549189","0.9817749787965896","0.04439592430858806","0.9506616486549189","10.407569141193596","1144.0","nan","3.0507472845475934","85.12026928675397","nan","10.0","0.9482646831122141","41.760399833120424","nan","-0.501042935533417","50.711045533115005","nan","nan","10.0","-0.03919608212030848","29.77423823733485","nan","-1.6857931744696484","28.845342066957787","nan","10.0","-1.4911828752029315","16.21857067549395","9.597889374090247","1055.0","0.979688395024371","0.14255822416302766","0.841573443111714","0.0","10.0","17.0","10992.0","0.0","0.0","16.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","94.11764705882352","5.88235294117647","nan","-1.1972600845920125","35.90636371906841","nan","-0.4250896848780795","26.506410017106628","nan","-0.7839021550500958","48.52893013100446","nan","0.08645947162697144","30.241492389979598","nan","-0.260617128652207","59.604416848617134","nan","0.44735729477907227","34.227219367990614","0.9863827944554124","0.06777656477438136","0.9246771388571129","0.9863827944554124","0.06777656477438136","0.9246771388571129","0.9863827944554124","0.06777656477438136","0.9246771388571129","0.9698982195381142","0.05413027656477438","0.9398412673504434","0.9698982195381142","0.05413027656477438","0.9398412673504434","0.9698982195381142","0.05413027656477438","0.9398412673504434","0.0","0.9956000692054666","0.007914847161572052","0.991204094219016"

 3. Past Usage:
     1. Smith,~J.~W., Everhart,~J.~E., Dickson,~W.~C., Knowler,~W.~C., &
        Johannes,~R.~S. (1988). Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast
        the onset of diabetes mellitus.  In {it Proceedings of the Symposium
        on Computer Applications and Medical Care} (pp. 261--265).  IEEE
        Computer Society Press.
 
        The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether the
        patient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organization
        criteria (i.e., if the 2 hour post-load plasma glucose was at least 
        200 mg/dl at any survey  examination or if found during routine medical
        care).   The population lives near Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
 
        Results: Their ADAP algorithm makes a real-valued prediction between
        0 and 1.  This was transformed into a binary decision using a cutoff of 
        0.448.  Using 576 training instances, the sensitivity and specificity
        of their algorithm was 76% on the remaining 192 instances.
 
 4. Relevant Information:
       Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from
       a larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females at
       least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  ADAP is an adaptive learning
       routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like
       devices.  It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.

**Large Soybean Database**  
This is the large soybean database from the UCI repository, with its training and test database combined into a single file. 

There are 19 classes, only the first 15 of which have been used in prior work. The folklore seems to be that the last four classes are unjustified by the data since they have so few examples. There are 35 categorical attributes, some nominal and some ordered. The value 'dna' means does not apply. The values for attributes are encoded numerically, with the first value encoded as ""0,'' the second as ""1,'' and so forth. An unknown value is encoded as ""?''.

SPAM E-mail Database  
The ""spam"" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/websites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography... Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam.  Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.
 
For background on spam:  
Cranor, Lorrie F., LaMacchia, Brian A.  Spam! Communications of the ACM, 41(8):74-83, 1998.  

### Attribute Information:  
The last column denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail. Most of the attributes indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occurring in the e-mail. The run-length attributes (55-57) measure the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters.  

For the statistical measures of each attribute, see the end of this file. Here are the definitions of the attributes:  

48 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type  
word_freq_WORD = percentage of words in the e-mail that match WORD,  i.e. 100 * (number of times the WORD appears in the e-mail) / total number of words in e-mail.  A ""word"" in this case is any string of alphanumeric characters bounded by non-alphanumeric characters or end-of-string.
 
6 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type char_freq_CHAR = percentage of characters in the e-mail that match CHAR, i.e. 100 * (number of CHAR occurences) / total characters in e-mail
 
1 continuous real [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_average
 = average length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters
 
1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_longest
 = length of longest uninterrupted sequence of capital letters
 
1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_total
 = sum of length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters
 = total number of capital letters in the e-mail
 
1 nominal {0,1} class attribute of type spam
 = denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0),

Primate splice-junction gene sequences (DNA) with associated imperfect domain theory.
Splice junctions are points on a DNA sequence at which 'superfluous' DNA is removed during the process of protein creation in higher organisms. The problem posed in this dataset is to recognize, given a sequence of DNA, the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). This problem consists of two subtasks: recognizing exon/intron boundaries (referred to as EI sites), and recognizing intron/exon boundaries (IE sites). (In the biological community, IE borders are referred to a ''acceptors'' while EI borders are referred to as ''donors''.)

All examples taken from Genbank 64.1. Categories ""ei"" and ""ie"" include every ""split-gene"" for primates in Genbank 64.1. Non-splice examples taken from sequences known not to include a splicing site.

 HISTORY
         This data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by
         JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd.
         The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing
         3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of
         shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects.
         Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes
         of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a class-
         ification rule tree by means of computer induction.
          This object recognition strategy was successfully used to 
         discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses
         viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.
          The rule tree classification performance compared favourably
         to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neigh-
         bour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and
         computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees
         generated by example indicated that the tree structure was 
         heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped
         similar object views into single decisions.
 
 DESCRIPTION
          The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS
         (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which 
         extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising
         both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance,
         skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic
         measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and
         compactness.
          Four ""Corgie"" model vehicles were used for the experiment:
         a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400.
         This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the 
         expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would
         be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to
         distinguish between the cars.
          The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the
         model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees
         to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse
         backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black
         to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000
         framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with
         a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels.
         These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes,
         negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and
         thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to
         remove ""salt and pepper"" image noise.
          The vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured
         using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees
         corresponded to ""head on"" and ""rear"" views respectively while 90 and
         270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of
         60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured
         for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between 
         images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.
          A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera 
         at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets
         also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains
         only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image
         at some orientations.

          The area of the bounding polygon is found as a side result of
         the computation to find the maximum length. Each individual
         length computation yields a pair of calipers to the object
         orientated at every 5 degrees. The object is propagated into
         an image containing the union of these calipers to obtain an
         image of the bounding polygon.

**Electricity** is a widely used dataset described by M. Harries and analyzed by J. Gama (see papers below). This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market. In this market, prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. Electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done to alleviate fluctuations.

The dataset (originally named ELEC2) contains 45,312 instances dated from 7 May 1996 to 5 December 1998. Each example of the dataset refers to a period of 30 minutes, i.e. there are 48 instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset has 5 fields, the day of week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states and the class label. The class label identifies the change of the price (UP or DOWN) in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last 24 hours (and removes the impact of longer term price trends). 

The data was normalized by A. Bifet.

The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood. The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number. 

One frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels. 

The database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. 

Each pixel is categorized as one of the following classes:  
1 red soil  
2 cotton crop  
3 grey soil  
4 damp grey soil  
5 soil with vegetation stubble  
6 mixture class (all types present)  
7 very damp grey soil  

NB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.  

The data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.  

### Attribute information  
There are 36 predictive attributes (= 4 spectral bands x 9 pixels in neighborhood).
In each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary. 

In this version, the pixel values 0..255 are normalized around 0.

**Note: it is unclear why the attributes are named Aattr - Fattr in this version, since there are only 4 bands and 9 pixels, naming them A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, B2, C2, D2, ... would have made more sense.**","0.18743194898117904","0.9273091445992578","0.14836702954898912","0.8167814524247422","0.9273091445992578","0.14836702954898912","0.8167814524247422","0.9273091445992578","0.14836702954898912","0.8167814524247422","2.4833618760456604","0.710936921295261","0.563452566096423","0.26828644698090565","0.0057542768273716955","nan","0.9197259342536087","0.14152410575427682","0.8249582236698434","0.9197259342536087","0.14152410575427682","0.8249582236698434","0.9197259342536087","0.14152410575427682","0.8249582236698434","23.81026438569207","1531.0","nan","1.277985361665814","-0.00012632970451019481","nan","6.0","0.91949549901627","1.0002882819750798","nan","-0.15411688047872","-0.0005560885260065659","nan","nan","6.0","0.04046023385100257","1.0000219953862926","nan","-0.9198282387807679","-0.000862968584758966","nan","6.0","-0.6740118722728707","0.9996387437607501","9.720062208398133","625.0","0.9605992160078025","0.20326594090202177","0.7513714566665727","0.0","6.0","37.0","6430.0","0.0","0.0","36.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","97.2972972972973","2.7027027027027026","nan","-0.8393811657498382","-0.0007437709953344221","nan","-0.5170961259457099","0.9999476046671038","nan","-0.4798469406404684","-0.0005980934681181398","nan","-0.0399749828019159","1.0000052923046026","nan","0.8509747335126359","-0.0003569454121306532","nan","0.6744458273485395","1.0001949690399905","0.962333455035218","0.15349922239502334","0.8100028845003834","0.962333455035218","0.15349922239502334","0.8100028845003834","0.962333455035218","0.15349922239502334","0.8100028845003834","0.8991170554983932","0.16625194401244167","0.7945482122759002","0.8991170554983932","0.16625194401244167","0.7945482122759002","0.8991170554983932","0.16625194401244167","0.7945482122759002","0.0","0.9355091276480466","0.10762052877138413","0.8673837948848537"

**Eucalyptus Soil Conservation**  
The objective was to determine which seedlots in a species are best for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country. Determination is found by measurement of height, diameter by height, survival, and other contributing factors. 
 
It is important to note that eucalypt trial methods changed over time; earlier trials included mostly 15 - 30cm tall seedling grown in peat plots and the later trials have included mostly three replications of eight trees grown. This change may contribute to less significant results.

Experimental data recording procedures which require noting include:
 - instances with no data recorded due to experimental recording procedures
   require that the absence of a species from one replicate at a site was
   treated as a missing value, but if absent from two or more replicates at a
   site the species was excluded from the site's analyses.
 - missing data for survival, vigour, insect resistance, stem form, crown form
   and utility especially for the data recorded at the Morea Station; this 
   could indicate the death of species in these areas or a lack in collection
   of data.

### Description

ISOLET (Isolated Letter Speech Recognition) dataset was generated as follows: 150 subjects spoke the name of each letter of the alphabet twice. Hence, there are 52 training examples from each speaker. The speakers are grouped into sets of 30 speakers each, 4 groups can serve as training set, the last group as the test set. A total of 3 examples are missing, the authors dropped them due to difficulties in recording. 

This is a good domain for a noisy, perceptual task. It is also a very good domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms. For example, C4.5 on this domain is slower than backpropagation!

**Vowel Recognition (Deterding data)**
Speaker independent recognition of the eleven steady state vowels of British English using a specified training set of lpc derived log area ratios.
Collected by David Deterding (data and non-connectionist analysis), Mahesan Niranjan (first connectionist analysis), Tony Robinson (description, program, data, and results)

A very comprehensive description including comments by the authors can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/vowel/vowel.names)

The problem is specified by the accompanying data file, ""vowel.data"".  This
consists of a three dimensional array: voweldata [speaker, vowel, input].
The speakers are indexed by integers 0-89.  (Actually, there are fifteen
individual speakers, each saying each vowel six times.)  The vowels are
indexed by integers 0-10.  For each utterance, there are ten floating-point
input values, with array indices 0-9.

The problem is to train the network as well as possible using only on data
from ""speakers"" 0-47, and then to test the network on speakers 48-89,
reporting the number of correct classifications in the test set.

For a more detailed explanation of the problem, see the excerpt from Tony
Robinson's Ph.D. thesis in the COMMENTS section.  In Robinson's opinion,
connectionist problems fall into two classes, the possible and the
impossible.  He is interested in the latter, by which he means problems
that have no exact solution.  Thus the problem here is not to see how fast
a network can be trained (although this is important), but to maximise a
less than perfect performance.

#### METHODOLOGY

Report the number of test vowels classified correctly, (i.e. the number of
occurences when distance of the correct output to the actual output was the
smallest of the set of distances from the actual output to all possible
target outputs).

Though this is not the focus of Robinson's study, it would also be useful
to report how long the training took (measured in pattern presentations or
with a rough count of floating-point operations required) and what level of
success was achieved on the training and testing data after various amounts
of training.  Of course, the network topology and algorithm used should be
precisely described as well.

#### VARIATIONS

This benchmark is proposed to encourage the exploration of different node
types.  Please theorise/experiment/hack.  The author (Robinson) will try to
correspond by email if requested.  In particular there has been some
discussion recently on the use of a cross-entropy distance measure, and it
would be interesting to see results for that.

#### Notes

1. Each of these numbers is based on a single trial with random starting
weights.  More trials would of course be preferable, but the computational
facilities available to Robinson were limited.

2. Graphs are given in Robinson's thesis showing test-set performance vs.
epoch count for some of the training runs.  In most cases, performance
peaks at around 250 correct, after which performance decays to different
degrees.  The numbers given above are final performance figures after about
3000 trials, not the peak performance obtained during the run.

**The Monk's Problems: Problem 1**  
Once upon a time, in July 1991, the monks of Corsendonk Priory were faced with a school held in their priory, namely the 2nd European Summer School on Machine Learning. After listening more than one week to a wide variety of learning algorithms, they felt rather confused: Which algorithm would be optimal? And which one to avoid? As a consequence of this dilemma, they created a simple task on which all learning algorithms ought to be compared: the three MONK's problems.

The target concept associated with the 1st Monk's problem is the binary outcome of the logical formula:  
MONK-1: (a1 == a2) or (a5 == 1)

In this dataset, the original train and test sets were merged to allow other sampling procedures. However, the original train-test splits can be found as one of the OpenML tasks.

The target concept associated with the 3rd Monk's problem is the binary outcome of the logical formula:  
MONK-3: (a5 = 3 and a4 = 1) or (a5 /= 4 and a2 /= 3)  
In addition, 5% class noise was added to the training set

In this dataset, the original train and test sets were merged to allow other sampling procedures. However, the original train-test splits can be found as one of the OpenML tasks.

**Japanese vowels**  
This dataset records 640 time series of 12 LPC cepstrum coefficients taken from nine male speakers.

The data was collected for examining our newly developed classifier for multidimensional curves (multidimensional time series). Nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels /ae/ successively. For each utterance, with the analysis parameters described below, we applied 12-degree linear prediction analysis to it to obtain a discrete-time series with 12 LPC cepstrum coefficients. This means that one utterance by a speaker forms a time series whose length is in the range 7-29 and each point of a time series is of 12 features (12 coefficients).

Similar data are available for different utterances /ei/, /iu/, /uo/, /oa/ in addition to /ae/. Please contact the donor if you are interested in using this data.

The number of the time series is 640 in total. We used one set of 270 time series for training and the other set of 370 time series for testing.

Analysis parameters:  
* Sampling rate : 10kHz
* Frame length : 25.6 ms
* Shift length : 6.4ms
* Degree of LPC coefficients : 12

Each line represents 12 LPC coefficients in the increasing order separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis
frame. Lines are organized into blocks, which are a set of 7-29 lines separated by blank lines and corresponds to a single speech utterance of /ae/ with 7-29 frames.

Each speaker is a set of consecutive blocks. In ae.train there are 30 blocks for each speaker. Blocks 1-30 represent speaker 1, blocks 31-60 represent speaker 2, and so on up to speaker 9. In ae.test, speakers 1 to 9 have the corresponding number of blocks: 31 35 88 44 29 24 40 50 29. Thus, blocks 1-31 represent speaker 1 (31 utterances of /ae/), blocks 32-66 represent speaker 2 (35 utterances of /ae/), and so on.

PRO FOOTBALL SCORES  (raw data appears after the description below)

How well do the oddsmakers of Las Vegas predict the outcome of
professional football games?  Is there really a home field advantage - if
so how large is it?  Are teams that play the Monday Night game at a
disadvantage when they play again the following Sunday?  Do teams benefit
from having a ""bye"" week off in the current schedule?  These questions and
a host of others can be investigated using this data set.

Hal Stern from the Statistics Department at Harvard University has
made available his compilation of scores for all National Football League
games from the 1989, 1990, and 1991 seasons.  Dr. Stern used these data as
part of his presentation ""Who's Number One?"" in the special ""Best of
Boston"" session at the 1992 Joint Statistics Meetings.

Several variables in the data are keyed to the oddsmakers ""point
spread"" for each game.  The point spread is a value assigned before each
game to serve as a handicap for whichever is perceived to be the better
team.  Thus, to win against the point spread, the ""favorite"" team must beat
the ""underdog"" team by more points than the spread.  The underdog ""wins""
against the spread if it wins the game outright or manages to lose by fewer
points than the spread.  In theory, the point spread should represent the
""expert"" prediction as to the game's outcome.  In practice, it more usually
denotes a point at which an equal amount of money will be wagered both for
and against the favored team.

The effects of the Growth Regulators Paclobutrazol (PP 333)
and Flurprimidol (EL-500) on the Number and Length of Internodes
in Terminal Sprouts Formed on Trimmed Silver Maple Trees.

Introduction:

The trimming of trees under distribution lines on city streets and
in rural areas is a major problem and expense for electrical
utilities.  Such operations are routinely performed at intervals of
one to eight years depending upon the individual species growth rate
and the amount of clearance required.  Ontario Hydro trims about
500,000 trees per year at a cost of about $25 per tree.

Much effort has been spent in developing chemicals for the horticultural
industry to retard the growth of woody and herbaceous plants.  Recently,
a group of new growth regulators was introduced which was shown to be
effective in controlling the growth of trees without producing
noticeable injury symptoms.  In this group are PP 333 ( common name
paclobutrazol) (2RS, 3RS - 1 -(4-chlorophenyl) - 4,4 - dimethyl - 2 -
(1,2,4-triazol-l-yl) pentan - 3- ol and EL-500 (common name flurprimidol
and composition alpha - (1-methylethyl) - alpha - [4-(trifluromethoxyl)
phenyl] - 5- pyrimidine - methanol).  Both EL-500 and PP-333 have been
reported to control excessive sprout growth in a number of species
when applied as a foliar spray, as a soil drench, or by trunk injection.
Sprout length is a function of both the number of internodes and
the length of the individual internodes in the sprout.  While there
have been many reports that both PP 333 and EL-500 cause a reduction
in the length of internodes formed in sprouts on woody plants treated
with the growth regulators, there has been but one report that EL-500
application to apple trees resulted in a reduction of the number
of internodes formed per sprout.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the length of the
terminal sprouts, the length of the individual internodes in those
sprouts, and the number of internodes in trimmed silver maple trees
following trunk injection with the growth regulators PP 333 and EL-500.

Experimental Details.

Multistemmed 12-year-old silver maple trees growing at Wesleyville,
Ontario were trunk injected with methanolic solutions of EL-500
and PP-333 in May of 1985 using a third generation Asplundh
tree injector.

Two different application rates (20 g/L and 4 g/L) were used for each
chemical.  The volume of solution (and hence the amount of active
ingredient) injected into each tree was determined from the diameter
of the tree, using the formula: vol(mL) = (dbh)*(dbh)*.492 where dbh
is the diameter at breast height.  Two sets of control trees were
included in the experiment.  In one set, tree received no injection
(control) and in a second set, the trees were injected with
methanol, the carrier in the growth regulator solutions.  Ten trees,
chosen at random, were used in each of the control and experimental
sets.  Prior to injection, all the trees were trimmed by a forestry
crew, with their heights being reduced by about one third.

In January 1987, twenty months after the trees were injected, between
six and eight limbs were removed at random from the bottom two-thirds
of the canopy of each of the ten trees in each experimental and control
set.  The limbs were returned to the laboratory and the length of all
the terminal sprouts, the lengths of the individual internodes, and
the number of internodes recorded.  Between one and 25 terminal
sprouts were found on each limb collected.  Sprouts which had a
length of 1 cm or less were recorded as being 1 cm in length.
In such spouts, the internode lengths were not measured, but were
calculated from the total length of the sprout and the number
of internodes counted.  Internode lengths were then expressed to one
decimal place.  In two instances, one of the ten trees in a set
could not be sampled because limb removal would have jeopardized the
health of the tree over the long-term.

Data set:

Each of the records represents a terminal sprout and contains the
following information:
N  - the sprout number
TR - treatment 1 - control
2 - methanol control
3 - PP 333 20g/L
4 - PP 333  4g/L
5 - EL 500 20g/L
6 - EL 500  4g/L
TREE - tree id
BR   - branch id
TL   - total sprout length (cm)
IN   - number of internodes on the sprout
INTER- a list of the lengths of the internodes in the sprout,
starting from the base of the sprout (1-29 entries)

Sprouts 1868 to 1879 do not have branch identification data.

The MNIST database of handwritten digits with 784 features, raw data available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. It can be split in a training set of the first 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples  

It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting. The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.  

With some classification methods (particularly template-based methods, such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors), the error rate improves when the digits are centered by bounding box rather than center of mass. If you do this kind of pre-processing, you should report it in your publications. The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's NIST originally designated SD-3 as their training set and SD-1 as their test set. However, SD-3 is much cleaner and easier to recognize than SD-1. The reason for this can be found on the fact that SD-3 was collected among Census Bureau employees, while SD-1 was collected among high-school students. Drawing sensible conclusions from learning experiments requires that the result be independent of the choice of training set and test among the complete set of samples. Therefore it was necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets.  

The MNIST training set is composed of 30,000 patterns from SD-3 and 30,000 patterns from SD-1. Our test set was composed of 5,000 patterns from SD-3 and 5,000 patterns from SD-1. The 60,000 pattern training set contained examples from approximately 250 writers. We made sure that the sets of writers of the training set and test set were disjoint. SD-1 contains 58,527 digit images written by 500 different writers. In contrast to SD-3, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, the data in SD-1 is scrambled. Writer identities for SD-1 is available and we used this information to unscramble the writers. We then split SD-1 in two: characters written by the first 250 writers went into our new training set. The remaining 250 writers were placed in our test set. Thus we had two sets with nearly 30,000 examples each. The new training set was completed with enough examples from SD-3, starting at pattern # 0, to make a full set of 60,000 training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with SD-3 examples starting at pattern # 35,000 to make a full set with 60,000 test patterns. Only a subset of 10,000 test images (5,000 from SD-1 and 5,000 from SD-3) is available on this site. The full 60,000 sample training set is available.","0.09564422348890698","0.9299296960617288","0.13245714285714286","0.8527729816031412","0.9299296960617288","0.13245714285714286","0.8527729816031412","0.9299296960617288","0.13245714285714286","0.8527729816031412","3.3198370254034137","0.6596630958148316","0.7950428571428572","0.11052914645302327","0.011214285714285715","nan","0.932729475291536","0.1268","0.8590627479657593","0.932729475291536","0.1268","0.8590627479657593","0.932729475291536","0.1268","0.8590627479657593","11.252857142857142","7877.0","nan","70000.00000000247","140.01505714285668","nan","10.0","264.57513110807787","113.88629683929352","nan","4894.714442707244","33.38596474125363","nan","nan","10.0","31.079435593429213","49.25570412611296","nan","-1.8254292785726658","0.0","nan","10.0","-0.23549660230998054","0.0","9.018571428571429","6313.0","0.937306319966156","0.30001428571428573","0.6663891986793616","0.0","10.0","785.0","70000.0","0.0","0.0","784.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","99.87261146496816","0.12738853503184713","nan","-1.0297320016722729","0.12058214285714541","nan","0.8744121903751375","4.670545729236738","nan","16.22683706266253","7.196049999999809","nan","4.134907396813174","36.765819161632194","nan","623.0827644398202","69.33461785714294","nan","23.939583112011796","100.84850801763852","0.9597205371114488","0.14168571428571428","0.8425153284961173","0.9597205371114488","0.14168571428571428","0.8425153284961173","0.9597205371114488","0.14168571428571428","0.8425153284961173","0.8806813200173884","0.2150142857142857","0.7610073553514332","0.8806813200173884","0.2150142857142857","0.7610073553514332","0.8806813200173884","0.2150142857142857","0.7610073553514332","0.0","0.9816188217574185","0.03307142857142857","0.9632397138736942"

Dataset from the Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge (http://www.agnostic.inf.ethz.ch), which consisted of 5 different datasets (SYLVA, GINA, NOVA, HIVA, ADA). The purpose of the challenge was to check if the performance of domain-specific feature engineering (prior knowledge) can be met by algorithms that were trained on data without any domain-specific knowledge (agnostic). For the latter, the data was anonymised and preprocessed in a way that makes them uninterpretable.

### Topic

The task of GINA is handwritten digit recognition. This is the agnostic version of a subset of the MNIST data set. We chose the problem of separating the odd numbers from even numbers. We use 2-digit numbers. Only the unit digit is informative for that task, therefore at least ½ of the features are distracters. This is a twoclass classification problem with sparse continuous input variables, in which each class is
composed of several clusters. It is a problems with heterogeneous classes.


### Source

The data set was constructed from the MNIST data that is made available by Yann
LeCun of the NEC Research Institute at [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of dimension 28x28. Examples are shown in the [documentation in chapter 3](http://clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/agnostic/Dataset.pdf).


### Description 

To construct the “agnostic” dataset, we performed the following steps:
- We removed the pixels that were 99% of the time white. This reduced the original
feature set of 784 pixels to 485.
- The original resolution (256 gray levels) was kept.
- In spite of the fact that the data are rather sparse (about 30% of the values are
non-zero), we saved the data as a dense matrix because we found that it can be
compressed better in this way (to 19 MB.)
- The feature names are the (i,j) matrix coordinates of the pixels (in a 28x28
matrix.)
- We created 2 digit numbers by dividing the datasets into to parts and pairing the
digits at random.
- The task is to separate odd from even numbers. The digit of the tens being not
informative, the features of that digit act as distracters.
To construct the “prior” dataset, we went back to the original data and fetched the
“informative” digit in its original representation. Therefore, this data representation
consists in a vector of concatenating the lines of a 28x28 pixel map.

created an observation. The observation period was between
May 29, 2002 and Feb 22, 2006.

Effect of Size on Defect Proneness for Open-Source Software"",

Abstract:
Quality is becoming increasingly important with the continuous
adoption of open-source software.  Previous research has found that
there is generally a positive relationship between module size and
defect proneness. Therefore, in open-source software development, it
is important to monitor module size and understand its impact on
defect proneness. However, traditional approaches to quality
modeling, which measure specific system snapshots and obtain future
defect counts, are not well suited because open-source modules
usually evolve and their size changes over time. In this study, we
used Cox proportional hazards modeling with recurrent events to
study the effect of class size on defect-proneness in the Mozilla
product. We found that the effect of size was significant, and we
quantified this effect on defect proneness.

5. Features:

This data set is used to create a conditional Cox Proportional
Hazards Model

id: A numeric identification assigned to each separate C++ class
(Note that the id's do not increment from the first to the last
data row)

start: A time infinitesimally greater than the time of the modification
that created this observation (practically, modification time). When a
class is introduced to a system, a new observation is entered with start=0

end: Either the time of the next modification, or the end of the
observation period, or the time of deletion, whichever comes first.

event: event is set to 1 if a defect fix takes place
at the time represented by 'end', or 0 otherwise.  A class deletion
is handled easily by entering a final observation whose event is set
to 1 if the class is deleted for corrective maintenance, or 0 otherwise.

size: It is a time-dependent covariate and its column carries the
number of source Lines of Code of the C++ classes
at time 'start'. Blank and comment lines are not counted.

state: Initially set to 0, and it becomes 1 after the class
experiences an event, and remains at 1 thereafter.","0.7130725681935152","0.9487463431444467","0.056481183660340946","0.8666354647527617","0.9487463431444467","0.056481183660340946","0.8666354647527617","0.9487463431444467","0.056481183660340946","0.8666354647527617","0.9134838311406803","0.8994176960934042","0.06555162431650048","0.8434656903703545","0.00038597619813444836","nan","0.9471577854343123","0.057317465422965584","0.865841427679572","0.9471577854343123","0.057317465422965584","0.865841427679572","0.9471577854343123","0.057317465422965584","0.865841427679572","67.1405596654873","10437.0","nan","53.590950174838504","676568.2015439087","nan","2.0","5.892621234393996","585391.1495024165","nan","9.97548065751711","221598.56303634783","nan","nan","2.0","1.4714719487731638","220055.54406718392","nan","-1.9250814918850943","0.5678996461884805","nan","2.0","-0.274164554996334","0.4953841184605772","32.859440334512705","5108.0","0.8283914088391722","0.31457060147957544","0.4004617644160084","1.0","2.0","6.0","15545.0","0.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","16.666666666666664","0.0","0.0","83.33333333333334","16.666666666666664","nan","-1.5578760957638447","217.2915728530073","nan","-0.1787991199473595","455.867937353985","nan","-0.7974463474031417","2097.573560630681","nan","0.6756672049543457","1151.8172588658424","nan","26.895300913258183","552730.3292377013","nan","3.5196453894030957","549107.0836011729","0.9538485433989626","0.0590543583145706","0.8621815044643241","0.9538485433989626","0.0590543583145706","0.8621815044643241","0.9538485433989626","0.0590543583145706","0.8621815044643241","0.9200748080232897","0.06954004503055645","0.8420434249559102","0.9200748080232897","0.06954004503055645","0.8420434249559102","0.9200748080232897","0.06954004503055645","0.8420434249559102","0.0","0.860730216403016","0.12370537150209071","0.7206608472775593"

### Results:
* Very simple learners (ROCKY) perform as well in this domain as more sophisticated methods (e.g. J48, model trees, model trees) for predicting detects
* Many learners have very low false alarm rates.
* Probability of detection (PD) rises with effort and rarely rises above it.
* High PDs are associated with high PFs (probability of failure)
* PD, PF, effort can change significantly while accuracy remains essentially stable
* With two notable exceptions, detectors learned from one data set (e.g. KC2) have nearly they same properties when applied to another (e.g. PC2, KC2). Exceptions:
* LinesOfCode measures generate wider inter-data-set variances;
* Precision's inter-data-set variances vary wildly

**Proceedings, workshop on Predictive Software Models, Chicago, Available from http://menzies.us/pdf/04psm.pdf.**

### Results:
* From JM1, Naive Bayes generated PDs of 25% with PF of 20%
* Naive Bayes out-performs J48 for defect detection
* When learning on more and more data, little improvement is seen after processing 300 examples.
* PDs are much higher from data collected below the sub-sub-system level.
* Accuracy is a surprisingly uninformative measure of success for a defect detector. Two detectors with the same accuracy can have widely varying PDs and PFs.

## Relevant information
* JM1 is written in ""C"" and is a real-time predictive ground system: Uses simulations to generate predictions
* Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code.  These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality. The nature of association is under dispute.

Notes on McCabe and Halstead follow.

* The McCabe and Halstead measures are ""module""-based where a ""module"" is the smallest unit of functionality. In C or Smalltalk, ""modules"" would be called ""function"" or ""method"" respectively.

* Defect detectors can be assessed according to the following measures:

    module actually has defects
    +-------------+------------+
    |     no      |     yes    |
    +-----+-------------+------------+
    classifier predicts no defects |  no |      a      |      b     |
    +-----+-------------+------------+
    classifier predicts some defects | yes |      c      |      d     |
    +-----+-------------+------------+


    accuracy                   = acc          = (a+d)/(a+b+c+d
    probability of detection   = pd  = recall = d/(b+d)
    probability of false alarm = pf           = c/(a+c)
    precision                  = prec         = d/(c+d)
    effort                     = amount of code selected by detector = (c.LOC + d.LOC)/(Total LOC)


Ideally, detectors have high PDs, low PFs, and low effort. This ideal state rarely happens:

* PD and effort are linked. The more modules that trigger the detector, the higher the PD. However, effort also gets increases
* High PD or low PF comes at the cost of high PF or low PD (respectively). This linkage can be seen in a standard receiver operator curve (ROC).  Suppose, for example, LOC> x is used as the detector (i.e. we assume large modules have more errors). LOC > x represents a family of detectors. At x=0, EVERY module is predicted to have errors. This detector has a high PD but also a high false alarm rate. At x=0, NO module is predicted to have errors. This detector has a low false alarm rate but won't detect anything at all. At 0<x PD=PF PF=0) PD=0) PD=1,PF> but does not reach it.
* The line pf=pd on the above graph represents the ""no information"" line. If pf=pd then the detector is pretty useless. The better the detector, the more it rises above PF=PD towards the ""sweet spot"".

NOTES ON MCCABE/HALSTEAD
========================
McCabe argued that code with complicated pathways are more error-prone.  His metrics therefore reflect the pathways within a code module.

    @Article{mccabe76,
    title  = ""A Complexity Measure"",
    author  = ""T.J. McCabe"",
    pages  = ""308--320"",
    journal = ""IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering"",
    year  = ""1976"",
    volume  = ""2"",
    month  = ""December"",
    number  = ""4""}

Halstead argued that code that is hard to read is more likely to be fault prone. Halstead estimates reading complexity by counting the number of concepts in a module; e.g. number of unique operators.

    @Book{halstead77,
    Author    = ""M.H. Halstead"",
    Title    = ""Elements of Software Science"",
    Publisher = ""Elsevier "",
    Year    = 1977}

We study these static code measures since they are useful, easy to use, and widely used:

* USEFUL: E.g. this data set can generate highly accurate predictors for defects
* EASY TO USE: Static code measures (e.g. lines of code, the McCabe/Halstead measures) can be automatically and cheaply collected.
* WIDELY USED: Many researchers use static measures to guide software quality predictions (see the reference list in the above ""blind spot"" paper. Verification and validation (V\&V) textbooks advise using static code complexity measures to decide which modules are worthy of manual inspections.  Further, we know of several large government software contractors that won't review software modules _unless_ tools like McCabe predict that they are fault prone.  Hence, defect detectors have a major economic impact when they may force programmers to rewrite code.

Nevertheless, the merits of these metrics has been widely criticized.  Static code measures are hardly a complete characterization of the internals of a function. Fenton offers an insightful example where the same functionality is achieved using different programming language constructs resulting in different static measurements for that module. Fenton uses this example to argue the uselessness of static code measures.

An alternative interpretation of Fenton's example is that static measures can never be a definite and certain indicator of the presence of a fault.  Rather, defect detectors based on static measures are best viewed as probabilistic statements that the frequency of faults tends to increase in code modules that trigger the detector.  By definition, such probabilistic statements will are not categorical claims with some a non-zero false alarm rate. The research challenge for data miners is to ensure that these false alarms do not cripple their learned theories.

The McCabe metrics are a collection of four software metrics: essential complexity, cyclomatic complexity, design complexity and LOC, Lines of Code.

* Cyclomatic Complexity, or ""v(G)"", measures the number of ""linearly independent paths"". A set of paths is said to be linearly independent if no path in the set is a linear combination of any other paths in the set through a program's ""flowgraph"". A flowgraph is a directed graph where each node corresponds to a program statement, and each arc indicates the flow of control from one statement to another. ""v(G)"" is calculated by ""v(G) = e - n + 2"" where ""G"" is a program's flowgraph, ""e"" is the number of arcs in the flowgraph, and ""n"" is the number of nodes in the flowgraph. The standard McCabes rules (""v(G)"">10), are used to identify fault-prone module.
* Essential Complexity, or ""ev(G)$"" is the extent to which a flowgraph can be ""reduced"" by decomposing all the subflowgraphs of $G$ that are ""D-structured primes"". Such ""D-structured primes"" are also sometimes referred to as ""proper one-entry one-exit subflowgraphs"" (for a more thorough discussion of D-primes, see the Fenton text referenced above). ""ev(G)"" is calculated using ""ev(G)= v(G) - m"" where $m$ is the number of subflowgraphs of ""G"" that are D-structured primes.
* Design Complexity, or ""iv(G)"", is the cyclomatic complexity of a module's reduced flowgraph.  The flowgraph, ""G"", of a module is reduced to eliminate any complexity which does not influence the interrelationship between design modules.  According to McCabe, this complexity measurement reflects the modules calling patterns to its immediate subordinate modules.
* Lines of code is measured according to McCabe's line counting conventions.

The Halstead falls into three groups: the base measures, the derived measures, and lines of code measures.

* Base measures:
  * mu1             = number of unique operators
  * mu2             = number of unique operands
  * N1              = total occurrences of operators
  * N2              = total occurrences of operands
  * length     = N  = N1 + N2
  * vocabulary = mu = mu1 + mu2
  * Constants set for each function:
  * mu1' =  2 = potential operator count (just the function name and the ""return"" operator)
  * mu2'      = potential operand count. (the number of arguments to the module)

For example, the expression ""return max(w+x,x+y)"" has ""N1=4"" operators ""return, max, +,+)"", ""N2=4"" operands (w,x,x,y), ""mu1=3"" unique operators (return, max,+), and ""mu2=3"" unique operands (w,x,y).

* Derived measures:
  * P = volume = V = N * log2(mu) (the number of mental comparisons needed to write
a program of length N)
  * V* = volume on minimal implementation = (2 + mu2')*log2(2 + mu2')
  * L  = program length = V*/N
  * D  = difficulty = 1/L
  * L' = 1/D
  * I  = intelligence = L'*V'
  * E  = effort to write program = V/L
  * T  = time to write program = E/18 seconds

KDD Cup 2009

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a key element of modern marketing strategies. The KDD Cup 2009 offers the opportunity to work on large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider (churn), buy new products or services (appetency), or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable (up-selling).
The most practical way, in a CRM system, to build knowledge on customer is to produce scores. A score (the output of a model) is an evaluation for all instances of a target variable to explain (i.e. churn, appetency or up-selling). Tools which produce scores allow to project, on a given population, quantifiable information. The score is computed using input variables which describe instances. Scores are then used by the information system (IS), for example, to personalize the customer relationship. An industrial customer analysis platform able to build prediction models with a very large number of input variables has been developed by Orange Labs. This platform implements several processing methods for instances and variables selection, prediction and indexation based on an efficient model combined with variable selection regularization and model averaging method. The main characteristic of this platform is its ability to scale on very large datasets with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of variables. The rapid and robust detection of the variables that have most contributed to the output prediction can be a key factor in a marketing application.
Appetency: In our context, the appetency is the propensity to buy a service or a product.
The training set contains 50,000 examples.
The first predictive 190 variables are numerical and the last 40 predictive variables are categorical.

The KDD Cup 2009 offers the opportunity to work on large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider (churn). 

Churn (wikipedia definition): Churn rate is also sometimes called attrition rate. It is one of two primary factors that determine
the steady-state level of customers a business will support. In its broadest sense, churn rate is a measure of the number
of individuals or items moving into or out of a collection over a specific period of time.

The term is used in many contexts, but is most widely applied in business with respect to a contractual customer base. For instance, it is an important factor for any business with a subscriber-based service model, including mobile telephone networks and pay TV operators. The term is also used to refer to participant turnover in peer-to-peer networks.

Up-selling (wikipedia definition): Up-selling is a sales technique whereby a salesman attempts to have the customer purchase more expensive
items, upgrades, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale.
Up-selling usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, but up-selling can also be simply exposing the customer
to other options he or she may not have considered previously.

Methods for multidimensional event classification: a case study using images from a Cherenkov gamma-ray telescope. Nucl.Instr.Meth. A, 516, pp. 511-528.  

The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background). 

Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions. 

The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in: 
D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).
The program was run with parameters allowing to observe events with energies down to below 50 GeV.

2. fWidth: continuous # minor axis of ellipse [mm] 
3. fSize: continuous # 10-log of sum of content of all pixels [in #phot]

5. fConc1: continuous # ratio of highest pixel over fSize [ratio] 
6. fAsym: continuous # distance from highest pixel to center, projected onto major axis [mm] 
7. fM3Long: continuous # 3rd root of third moment along major axis [mm] 
8. fM3Trans: continuous # 3rd root of third moment along minor axis [mm] 
9. fAlpha: continuous # angle of major axis with vector to origin [deg] 
10. fDist: continuous # distance from origin to center of ellipse [mm] 
11. class: g,h # gamma (signal), hadron (background) 

g = gamma (signal): 12332 
h = hadron (background): 6688 

For technical reasons, the number of h events is underestimated. In the real data, the h class represents the majority of the events. 

The simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal event as background. For comparison of different classifiers an ROC curve has to be used. The relevant points on this curve are those, where the probability of accepting a background event as signal is below one of the following thresholds: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 depending on the required quality of the sample of the accepted events for different experiments.","0.9999474210000526","0.8572921379124913","0.17697160883280758","0.5914141715321543","0.8572921379124913","0.17697160883280758","0.5914141715321543","0.8572921379124913","0.17697160883280758","0.5914141715321543","0.9355152445467361","0.7297272713693088","0.27581493165089377","0.42523478186335173","0.0006309148264984228","nan","0.8519177470078234","0.15904311251314407","0.6385741021369216","0.8519177470078234","0.15904311251314407","0.6385741021369216","0.8519177470078234","0.15904311251314407","0.6385741021369216","64.83701366982125","12332.0","nan","16.765406683786946","193.81802646687697","nan","2.0","3.371627980775544","74.73178696313772","nan","4.2731596123284605","30.677838007360673","nan","nan","2.0","0.6463449554867172","29.33458602526222","nan","-0.5337036036008977","-4.331745157728721","nan","2.0","-1.1230780552847428","0.11051079890195727","35.16298633017876","6688.0","0.7566647723171501","0.2732386961093586","0.3285481368790712","1.0","2.0","12.0","19020.0","0.0","0.0","11.0","1.0","8.333333333333332","0.0","0.0","91.66666666666666","8.333333333333332","nan","-0.21475672018584502","0.2409587513144063","nan","-0.17151941301349327","0.4001522733222914","nan","2.699126116854708","6.685280888538376","nan","0.5857915398743723","23.4655297287932","nan","8.261585440584037","34.04681848974762","nan","1.160043459148741","53.05160400659326","0.8736396474841971","0.15304942166140903","0.6509075862290208","0.8736396474841971","0.15304942166140903","0.6509075862290208","0.8736396474841971","0.15304942166140903","0.6509075862290208","0.7894630872418122","0.19106203995793902","0.5801171262317406","0.7894630872418122","0.19106203995793902","0.5801171262317406","0.7894630872418122","0.19106203995793902","0.5801171262317406","0.0","0.772223037674188","0.1967402733964248","0.5577522117347957"

This database has been artificially generated. It describes the structure of the capital letters A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, P, R, indicated by a number 1-10, in that order (A=1,C=2,...). Each letter's structure is described by a set of segments (lines) which resemble the way an automatic program would segment an image. The dataset consists of 600 such descriptions per letter. 

Originally, each 'instance' (letter) was stored in a separate file, each consisting of between 1 and 7 segments, numbered 0,1,2,3,... Here they are merged. That means that the first 5 instances describe the first 5 segments of the first segmentation of the first letter (A). Also, the training set (100 examples) and test set (the rest) are merged. The next 7 instances describe another segmentation (also of the letter A) and so on.

### Attribute Information  

* V1: object number, the number of the segment (0,1,2,..,7)  
* V2-V5: the initial and final coordinates of a segment in a cartesian plane (XX1,YY1,XX2,YY2).  
* V6: size, this is the length of a segment computed by using the geometric distance between two points A(X1,Y1) and B(X2,Y2).
* V7: diagonal, this is the length of the diagonal of the smallest rectangle which includes the picture of the character. The value of this attribute is the same in each object.

**Bank Marketing**  
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. 

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

Dataset about distinguishing genuine and forged banknotes. Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. A Wavelet Transform tool was used to extract features from these images.

**Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set**  
Data taken from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan -- this is a classification problem.

To demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model (a modified version of RFM), this study adopted the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. To build an FRMTC model, we selected 748 donors at random from the donor database. 

### Attribute Information

2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.

This data was constructed using LLNL's UQ Pipeline, was created under the auspices of the US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344, was funded by LLNL's Uncertainty Quantification Strategic Initiative Laboratory Directed Research and Development Project under tracking code 10-SI-013, and is released under UCRL number LLNL-MISC-633994.


Data Set Information:

This dataset contains records of simulation crashes encountered during climate model uncertainty quantification (UQ) ensembles. Ensemble members were constructed using a Latin hypercube method in LLNL's UQ Pipeline software system to sample the uncertainties of 18 model parameters within the Parallel Ocean Program (POP2) component of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4). Three separate Latin hypercube ensembles were conducted, each containing 180 ensemble members. 46 out of the 540 simulations failed for numerical reasons at combinations of parameter values. The goal is to use classification to predict simulation outcomes (fail or succeed) from input parameter values, and to use sensitivity analysis and feature selection to determine the causes of simulation crashes. Further details about the data and methods are given in the publication 'Failure Analysis of Parameter-Induced Simulation Crashes in Climate Models,' Geoscientific Model Development [(Web Link)](doi:10.5194/gmdd-6-585-2013).


Attribute Information:

The goal is to predict climate model simulation outcomes (column 21, fail or succeed) given scaled values of climate model input parameters (columns 3-20). 

- Column 1: Latin hypercube study ID (study 1 to study 3) 

- Column 2: simulation ID (run 1 to run 180) 

- Columns 3-20: values of 18 climate model parameters scaled in the interval [0, 1] 

- Column 21: simulation outcome (0 = failure, 1 = success)

### Data Set Information

This is a data set containing 1080 documents of free text business descriptions of Brazilian companies categorized into a 
subset of 9 categories cataloged in a table called National Classification of Economic Activities (Classificação Nacional de 
Atividade Econômicas - CNAE). The original texts were preprocessed to obtain the current data set: initially, it was kept only letters and then it was removed prepositions of the texts. Next, the words were transformed to their canonical form. Finally, 
each document was represented as a vector, where the weight of each word is its frequency in the document. 
This data set is highly sparse (99.22% of the matrix is filled with zeros).

### Attribute Information

In the dataset there are 857 attributes, 1 attributes with the class of instance and 856 with word frequency:
 ```
1. category: range 1 - 9 (integer)   
2. 857. word frequency: (integer)
```

All data is from one continuous EEG measurement with the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset. The duration of the measurement was 117 seconds. The eye state was detected via a camera during the EEG measurement and added later manually to the file after analyzing the video frames. '1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state. All values are in chronological order with the first measured value at the top of the data.

The features correspond to 14 EEG measurements from the headset, originally labeled AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4, in that order.","0.9984645169904534","0.815562880843502","0.22923898531375167","0.5343988170412974","0.815562880843502","0.22923898531375167","0.5343988170412974","0.815562880843502","0.22923898531375167","0.5343988170412974","0.992422373387609","0.5730896889672722","0.41141522029372496","0.12923993775163797","0.0010013351134846463","nan","0.8271933877278838","0.1863818424566088","0.6230255040333611","0.8271933877278838","0.1863818424566088","0.6230255040333611","0.8271933877278838","0.1863818424566088","0.6230255040333611","55.12016021361815","8257.0","nan","14979.178735371073","4644.02237917223","nan","2.0","122.38777688436316","5891.2850425236575","nan","8904.72190163755","4316.882028546157","nan","nan","2.0","71.73726620900297","1767.2884824189532","nan","2056.5210594418404","4009.767693591455","nan","2.0","-13.615160740498586","29.292603201776053","44.879839786381844","6723.0","0.5441157198060068","0.4634846461949266","0.11130397334752887","1.0","2.0","15.0","14980.0","0.0","0.0","14.0","1.0","6.666666666666667","0.0","0.0","93.33333333333333","6.666666666666667","nan","2713.5598368066608","4193.079256508679","nan","22.475026893669664","37.98467230942155","nan","9352.695219763142","4271.6276034712955","nan","84.61113200877784","627.1558153704191","nan","14971.654606997874","4466.12820822263","nan","122.34170603745707","3343.823788627256","0.8585707193015194","0.19072096128170896","0.6126693923072585","0.8585707193015194","0.19072096128170896","0.6126693923072585","0.8585707193015194","0.19072096128170896","0.6126693923072585","0.8092130970110125","0.18845126835781043","0.6188451689674707","0.8092130970110125","0.18845126835781043","0.6188451689674707","0.8092130970110125","0.18845126835781043","0.6188451689674707","0.0","0.8331954978013598","0.16355140186915887","0.6684228094245078"

### Dataset Information

This archive contains 13910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors utilized in simulations for drift compensation in a discrimination task of 6 gases at various levels of concentrations.  
The goal is to achieve good performance (or as low degradation as possible) over time, as reported in the paper mentioned below in Section 2: Data collection. 

The primary purpose of providing this dataset is to make it freely accessible online to the chemo-sensor research community and artificial intelligence to develop strategies to cope with sensor/concept drift. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.

The dataset was gathered within January 2007 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. 

Being completely operated by a fully computerized environment controlled by a LabVIEW's National Instruments software on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial data acquisition boards. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift.

The resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances, namely Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene, each dosed at a wide variety of concentration values ranging from 5 to 1000 ppmv. An extension of this dataset with the concentration values is available at [Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset at Different Concentrations Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Sensor+Array+Drift+Dataset+at+Different+Concentrations).


### Attribute Information

The response of the said sensors is read-out in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor. Hence each measurement produced a 16-channel time series, each of which represented by an aggregate of features reflecting all the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated. 

In particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset: 
(i) The so-called steady-state feature (Î”R), defined as the difference of the maximal resistance change and the baseline and its normalized version expressed by the ratio of the maximal resistance and the baseline values when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber; and 
(ii) an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing/decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement procedure under controlled conditions, namely the exponential moving average (emaÎ±). These aggregate of features is a transform, borrowed from the field of econometrics originally introduced to the chemo-sensing community by Muezzinoglu et al. (2009), that converts the said transient portion into a real scalar, by estimating the maximum value â€”minimum for the decaying portion of the sensor responseâ€” of its exponential moving average (emaÎ±), with an initial condition set to zero and a scalar smoothing parameter of the operator, Î±, that defines both the quality of the feature and the time of its occurrence along the time series the scalar, set to range between 0 and 1. In particular, three different values for Î± were set to obtain three different feature values from the pre-recorded rising portion of the sensor response and three additional features with the same Î± values but for the decaying portion of the sensor response, covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics. 

For a more detailed analysis and discussion on these features as well as a graphical illustration of them please refer to Section 2.3 and Figure 2, respectively of the annotated manuscript.

Once the abovementioned features are calculated, one is to form a feature vector containing the 8 features extracted from each particular sensor multiplied by the 16 sensors considered here. In the end, there is a resulting 128-dimensional feature vector containing all the features indicated above.

There are six possible classes: 
```
1: Ethanol 
2: Ethylene  
3: Ammonia 
4: Acetaldehyde 
5: Acetone 
6: Toluene
```

**Human Activity Recognition**  
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. This dataset version contains all the training and testing examples provided in the original data repository.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low-frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


### Attribute Information  
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.  
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.  
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  
* It's activity label.

#### Abstract: 

MADELON is an artificial dataset, which was part of the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge. This is a two-class classification problem with continuous input variables. The difficulty is that the problem is multivariate and highly non-linear.

#### Data Set Information:

MADELON is an artificial dataset containing data points grouped in 32 clusters placed on the vertices of a five-dimensional hypercube and randomly labeled +1 or -1. The five dimensions constitute 5 informative features. 15 linear combinations of those features were added to form a set of 20 (redundant) informative features. Based on those 20 features one must separate the examples into the 2 classes (corresponding to the +-1 labels). It was added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized. 

This dataset is one of five datasets used in the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge. The original data was split into training, validation and test set. Target values are provided only for two first sets (not for the test set). So, this dataset version contains all the examples from training and validation partitions. 

There is no attribute information provided to avoid biasing the feature selection process.

The aim of this dataset is to distinguish between nasal (class 0) and oral sounds (class 1). Five different attributes were chosen to characterize each vowel: they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics AHi, normalised by the total energy Ene (integrated on all the frequencies): AHi/Ene. The phonemes are transcribed as follows: sh as in she, dcl as in dark, iy as the vowel in she, aa as the vowel in dark, and ao as the first vowel in water.  

### Source

The current dataset was formatted by the KEEL repository, but originally hosted by the [ELENA Project](https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/neural-nets/Research/Projects/ELENA/elena.htm#stuff). The dataset originates from the European ESPRIT 5516 project: ROARS. The aim of this project was the development and the implementation of a real time analytical system for French and Spanish speech recognition.  

### Relevant information

Most of the already existing speech recognition systems are global systems (typically Hidden Markov Models and Time Delay Neural Networks) which recognizes signals and do not really use the speech
specificities.  On the contrary, analytical systems take into account the articulatory process leading to the different phonemes of a given language, the idea being to deduce the presence of each of the
phonetic features from the acoustic observation.

The main difficulty of analytical systems is to obtain acoustical parameters sufficiantly reliable. These acoustical measurements must :

   - contain all the information relative to the concerned phonetic feature.
   - being speaker independent.
   - being context independent.
   - being more or less robust to noise.

The primary acoustical observation is always voluminous (spectrum x N different observation moments) and classification cannot been processed directly.

In ROARS, the initial database is provided by cochlear spectra, which may be seen as the output of a filters bank having a constant DeltaF/F0, where the central frequencies are distributed on a
logarithmic scale (MEL type) to simulate the frequency answer of the auditory nerves.  The filters outputs are taken every 2 or 8 msec (integration on 4 or 16 msec) depending on the type of phoneme
observed (stationary or transitory).  

The aim of the present database is to distinguish between nasal and
oral vowels. There are thus two different classes:

- Class 0 : Nasals  
- Class 1 : Orals        

This database contains vowels coming from 1809 isolated syllables (for example: pa, ta, pan,...). Five different attributes were chosen to characterize each vowel: they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics AHi, normalised by the total energy Ene (integrated on all the frequencies): AHi/Ene. Each harmonic is signed: positive when it corresponds to a local maximum of the spectrum and negative otherwise.

Three observation moments have been kept for each vowel to obtain 5427 different instances: 

 - the observation corresponding to the maximum total energy Ene. 
   
 - the observations taken 8 msec before and 8 msec after the observation corresponding to this maximum total energy.

From these 5427 initial values, 23 instances for which the amplitude of the 5 first harmonics was zero were removed, leading to the 5404 instances of the present database. The patterns are presented in a random order.

```

### Dataset Information

The original data directory contains the binary images (masks) of the leaf samples (colour images not included).
There are three features for each image: Shape, Margin and Texture.
For each feature, a 64 element vector is given per leaf sample.
These vectors are taken as a contiguous descriptor (for shape) or histograms (for texture and margin).
So, there are three different files, one for each feature problem:  
 * 'data_Sha_64.txt' -> prediction based on shape
 * 'data_Tex_64.txt' -> prediction based on texture
 * 'data_Mar_64.txt' -> prediction based on margin [**dataset provided here**] 

Each row has a 64-element feature vector followed by the Class label.

 Donor of database Charles Mallah: charles.mallah@kingston.ac.uk; James Cope:  james.cope@kingston.ac.uk  
```

### Dataset Information

The original data directory contains the binary images (masks) of the leaf samples (colour images not included).
There are three features for each image: Shape, Margin and Texture.
For each feature, a 64 element vector is given per leaf sample.
These vectors are taken as a contiguous descriptor (for shape) or histograms (for texture and margin).
So, there are three different files, one for each feature problem:  
 * 'data_Sha_64.txt' -> prediction based on shape [**dataset provided here**]
 * 'data_Tex_64.txt' -> prediction based on texture
 * 'data_Mar_64.txt' -> prediction based on margin  

Each row has a 64-element feature vector followed by the Class label.
There is a total of 1600 samples with 16 samples per leaf class (100 classes), and no missing values.

### Attributes Information

Three 64 element feature vectors per sample.

QSAR biodegradation Data Set 

* Abstract: 

Data set containing values for 41 attributes (molecular descriptors) used to classify 1055 chemicals into 2 classes (ready and not ready biodegradable).

* Data Set Information:

The QSAR biodegradation dataset was built in the Milano Chemometrics and QSAR Research Group (UniversitÃ  degli Studi Milano â€“ Bicocca, Milano, Italy). The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Communityâ€™s Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] under Grant Agreement n. 238701 of Marie Curie ITN Environmental Chemoinformatics (ECO) project. 
The data have been used to develop QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) models for the study of the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules. Biodegradation experimental values of 1055 chemicals were collected from the webpage of the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan (NITE). Classification models were developed in order to discriminate ready (356) and not ready (699) biodegradable molecules by means of three different modelling methods: k Nearest Neighbours, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines. Details on attributes (molecular descriptors) selected in each model can be found in the quoted reference: Mansouri, K., Ringsted, T., Ballabio, D., Todeschini, R., Consonni, V. (2013).

**Wall-Following Robot Navigation Data Data Set**  
The data were collected as the SCITOS G5 robot navigates through the room following the wall in a clockwise direction, for 4 rounds, using 24 ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its 'waist'.

The data consists of raw values of the measurements of all 24 ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label. Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of 9 samples per second.

The class labels are:  
1. Move-Forward,  
2. Slight-Right-Turn,  
3. Sharp-Right-Turn,  
4. Slight-Left-Turn  

It is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step). 

The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions.

### Dataset Description

Semeion Handwritten Digit Data Set, where 1593 handwritten digits from around 80 persons were scanned and documented. The each of the 256 variables V1 - V256 describe one of the pixels and their corresponding values. 

### Sources

The dataset was created by Tactile Srl, Brescia, Italy (http://www.tattile.it) and donated in 1994 to Semeion Research Center of Sciences of Communication, Rome, Italy (http://www.semeion.it), for machine learning research.

### DataSet Information

A total of 1593 handwritten digits from around 80 persons were scanned, stretched in a rectangular box 16x16 in a gray scale of 256 values. Then each pixel of each image was scaled into a boolean (1/0) value using a fixed threshold. 

Each person wrote in a paper all the digits from 0 to 9, twice. The commitment was to write the digit the first time in the normal way (trying to write each digit accurately) and the second time in a fast way (with no accuracy). 

The best validation protocol for this dataset seems to be a 5x2CV, 50% Tune (Train +Test) and completely blind 50% Validation

### Attribute Information

This dataset consists of 1593 records (rows) and 256 attributes (columns). 
Each record represents a handwritten digit, originally scanned with a resolution of 256 grays scale (28). 
Each pixel of the each original scanned image was first stretched, and after scaled between 0 and 1 (setting to 0 every pixel whose value was under the value 127 of the grey scale (127 included) and setting to 1 each pixel whose original value in the grey scale was over 127). 
Finally, each binary image was scaled again into a 16x16 square box (the final 256 binary attributes).

**Steel Plates Faults Data Set**  
A dataset of steel plates' faults, classified into 7 different types. The goal was to train machine learning for automatic pattern recognition.

The dataset consists of 27 features describing each fault (location, size, ...) and 7 binary features indicating the type of fault (on of 7: Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, Other_Faults). The latter is commonly used as a binary classification target ('common' or 'other' fault.)

**Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (WDBC).** Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target feature records the prognosis (benign (1) or malignant (2)). [Original data available here](ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/cancer/) 

Current dataset was adapted to ARFF format from the UCI version. Sample code ID's were removed.  

! Note that there is also a related Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set with a different set of features, better known as [breast-w](https://www.openml.org/d/15).


### Feature description  

Ten real-valued features are computed for each of 3 cell nuclei, yielding a total of 30 descriptive features. See the papers below for more details on how they were computed. The 10 features (in order) are:  

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)  
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)  
c) perimeter  
d) area  
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)  
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)  
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)  
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)  
i) symmetry  
j) fractal dimension (""coastline approximation"" - 1)

* Dataset Title: MicroMass - Mixed (mixed spectra version)   

* Abstract:   
A dataset to explore machine learning approaches for the identification of microorganisms from mass-spectrometry data.

* Data Set Information:

This MALDI-TOF dataset consists in:
A) A reference panel of 20 Gram positive and negative bacterial species covering 9 genera among which several species are known to be hard to discriminate by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Each species was represented by 11 to 60 mass spectra obtained from 7 to 20 bacterial strains, constituting altogether a dataset of 571 spectra obtained from 213 strains. The spectra were obtained according to the standard culture-based workflow used in clinical routine in which the microorganism was first grown on an agar plate for 24 to 48 hours, before a portion of colony was picked, spotted on a MALDI slide and a mass spectrum was acquired. 
B) Based on this reference panel, a dedicated in vitro mock-up mixture dataset was constituted. For that purpose we considered 10 pairs of species of various taxonomic proximity:
* 4 mixtures, labelled A, B, C and D, involved species that belong to the same genus,  
* 2 mixtures, labelled E and F, involved species that belong to distinct genera, but to the same Gram type,  
* 4 mixtures, labelled G, H, I and J, involved species that belong to distinct Gram types.  
Each mixture was represented by 2 pairs of strains, which were mixed according to the following 9 concentration ratios : 1:0, 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 0:1. Two replicate spectra were acquired for each concentration ratio and each couple of strains, leading altogether to a dataset of 360 spectra, among which 80 are actually pure sample spectra.

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year. Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))

This is the original version from the UCI repository, with training and test sets merged.

### Variable description

Variables are all self-explanatory except __fnlwgt__. This is a proxy for the demographic background of the people: ""People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights"". This similarity-statement is not transferable across the 51 different states.

Description from the donor of the database: 

The weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau. We use 3 sets of controls. These are:
1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.
2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.
3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.

We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and ""rake"" through them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used. The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating ""weighted tallies"" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the population. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. There is one important caveat to remember about this statement. That is that since the CPS sample is actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own probability of selection, the statement only applies within state.

This is the original version of the famous covertype dataset in ARFF format. 

**Covertype**  
Predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System &#40;RIS&#41; data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types). 

This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices. 

Some background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2) probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value. 

As for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4). 

The Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.) Cache la Poudre would probably be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low elevation range and species composition.

Attribute Information:  
Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The forest cover type is the classification problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.

Predict a biological response of molecules from their chemical properties. Each row in this data set represents a molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing an actual biological response; the molecule was seen to elicit this response (1), or not (0). The remaining columns represent molecular descriptors (d1 through d1776), these are calculated properties that can capture some of the characteristics of the molecule - for example size, shape, or elemental constitution. The descriptor matrix has been normalized.

### Description

The data consists of real historical data collected from 2010 & 2011.  Employees are manually allowed or denied access to resources over time. 
The data is used to create an algorithm capable of learning from this historical data to predict approval/denial for an unseen set of employees.

### Dataset Information

When an employee at any company starts work, they first need to obtain the computer access necessary to fulfill their role. This access may allow an employee to read/manipulate resources through various applications or web portals. It is assumed that employees fulfilling the functions of a given role will access the same or similar resources. It is often the case that employees figure out the access they need as they encounter roadblocks during their daily work (e.g. not able to log into a reporting portal). A knowledgeable supervisor then takes time to manually grant the needed access in order to overcome access obstacles. As employees move throughout a company, this access discovery/recovery cycle wastes a non-trivial amount of time and money.

There is a considerable amount of data regarding an employee&rsquo;s role within an organization and the resources to which they have access. Given the data related to current employees and their provisioned access, models can be built that automatically determine access privileges as employees enter and leave roles within a company. These auto-access models seek to minimize the human involvement required to grant or revoke employee access.

The original training and test set were merged.

Data Set Information:

The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21 features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are functions of the first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and 5-layer neural networks are presented in the original paper. The last 500,000 examples are used as a test set.


Attribute Information:

The first column is the class label (1 for signal, 0 for background), followed by the 28 features (21 low-level features then 7 high-level features): lepton pT, lepton eta, lepton phi, missing energy magnitude, missing energy phi, jet 1 pt, jet 1 eta, jet 1 phi, jet 1 b-tag, jet 2 pt, jet 2 eta, jet 2 phi, jet 2 b-tag, jet 3 pt, jet 3 eta, jet 3 phi, jet 3 b-tag, jet 4 pt, jet 4 eta, jet 4 phi, jet 4 b-tag, m_jj, m_jjj, m_lv, m_jlv, m_bb, m_wbb, m_wwbb. For more detailed information about each feature see the original paper.

Data Set Information:

One of the challenges faced by our research was the unavailability of reliable training datasets. In fact this challenge faces any researcher in the field. However, although plenty of articles about predicting phishing websites have been disseminated these days, no reliable training dataset has been published publically, may be because there is no agreement in literature on the definitive features that characterize phishing webpages, hence it is difficult to shape a dataset that covers all possible features. 
In this dataset, we shed light on the important features that have proved to be sound and effective in predicting phishing websites. In addition, we propose some new features.

### Data Set Information

The data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex. There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a total of 72 mice. In the experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, and for trisomic mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080 measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independent sample/mouse. 

The eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype, behavior and treatment. According to genotype, mice can be control or trisomic. According to behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some mice have been injected with the drug and others have not. 

Classes: 
```
* c-CS-s: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) 
* c-CS-m: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) 
* c-SC-s: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) 
* c-SC-m: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) 
* t-CS-s: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (7 mice) 
* t-CS-m: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice) 
* t-SC-s: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) 
* t-SC-m: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice) 
```

The aim is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between the classes.

**Higgs Boson detection data**. The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21 features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are functions of the first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. The last 500,000 examples are used as a test set.

**Note: This is the UCI Higgs dataset, same as version 1, but it fixes the definition of the class attribute, which is categorical, not numeric.**


### Attribute Information

**LED display data set**  
This simple domain contains 7 Boolean attributes and 10 classes, the set of decimal digits. Recall that LED displays contain 7 light-emitting diodes -- hence the reason for 7 attributes. The class attribute is an integer ranging between 0 and 9 inclusive, representing the possible digits show on the display.

The problem would be easy if not for the introduction of noise.  In this case, each attribute value has the 10% probability of having its value inverted.  

It's valuable to know the optimal Bayes rate for these databases. In this case, the misclassification rate is 26% (74% classification accuracy).

####3. Relevant Information:

The aim is to distinguish between 11 different textures (Grass lawn, Pressed calf leather, Handmade paper, Raffia looped to a high pile, Cotton canvas, ...), each pattern (pixel) being characterised by 40 attributes built by the estimation of fourth order modified moments in four orientations: 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees.

A statistical method based on the extraction of fourth order moments for the characterization of natural micro-textures was developed called ""fourth order modified moments"" (mm4) [Guerin93], this method measures the deviation from first-order Gauss-Markov process, for each texture. The features were estimated in four directions to take into account the possible orientations of the textures (0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees). Only correlation between the current pixel, the first neighbourhood and the second neighbourhood are taken into account. This small neighbourhood is adapted to the fine grain property of the textures.

The data set contains 11 classes of 500 instances and each class refers to a type of texture in the Brodatz album.

The database dimension is 40 plus one for the class label. The 40 attributes were build respectively by the estimation of the following fourth order modified moments in four orientations: 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees: mm4(000), mm4(001), mm4(002), mm4(011), mm4(012), mm4(022), mm4(111), mm4(112), mm4(122) and mm4(222).

!! Patterns are always sorted by class and are presented in the increasing order of their class label in each dataset relative to the texture database (texture.dat, texture_CR.dat, texture_PCA.dat, texture_DFA.dat)

####4. Class:

The class label is a code for the following classes:
```
                Class         Class label

  3   Pressed calf leather            (D24) 
  4   Handmade paper                  (D57) 
  6   Raffia looped to a high pile:   (D84) 
  7   Cotton canvas                   (D77) 
  8   Pigskin                         (D92) 
  9   Beach sand:                     (D28) 
  10  Beach sand                      (D29)

7. Result of the Principal Component Analysis:

The Principal Components Analysis is a very classical method in pattern recognition [Duda73]. PCA reduces the sample dimension in a linear way for the best representation in lower dimensions keeping the maximum of inertia. The best axe for the representation is however not necessary the best axe for the discrimination. After PCA, features are selected according to the percentage of initial inertia which is covered by the different axes and the number of features is determined according to the percentage of initial inertia to keep for the classification process.

This selection method has been applied on the texture_CR database. When quasi-linear correlations exists between some initial features, these redundant dimensions are removed by PCA and this preprocessing is then recommended. In this case, before a PCA, the determinant of the data covariance matrix is near zero; this database is thus badly conditioned for all process which use this information (the quadratic classifier for example).

The following file is available for the texture database: ''texture_PCA.dat.Z'', it is the projection of the ''texture_CR'' database on its principal components (sorted in a decreasing order of the related inertia percentage; so, if you desire to work on the database projected on its x first principal components you only have to keep the x first attributes of the texture_PCA.dat database and the class labels (last attribute)).

Table here below provides the inertia percentages associated to the eigenvalues corresponding to the principal component axis sorted in the decreasing order of the associated inertia percentage. 99.85 percent of the total database inertia will remain if the 20 first principal components are kept.

This matrix can be found in the texture_EV.dat file.

The Discriminant Factorial Analysis (DFA) can be applied to a learning database where each learning sample belongs to a particular class [Duda73]. The number of discriminant features selected by DFA is fixed in function of the number of classes (c) and of the number of input dimensions (d); this number is equal to the minimum between d and c-1. In the usual case where d is greater than c, the output dimension is fixed equal to the number of classes minus one and the discriminant axes are selected in order to maximize the between-variance and to minimize the within-variance of the classes.

The discrimination power (ratio of the projected between-variance over the projected within-variance) is not the same for each discriminant axis: this ratio decreases for each axis. So for a problem with many classes, this preprocessing will not be always efficient as the last output features will not be so discriminant. This analysis uses the information of the inverse of the global covariance matrix, so the covariance matrix must be well conditioned (for example, a preliminary PCA must be applied to remove the linearly correlated dimensions).

The Discriminant Factorial Analysis (DFA) has been applied on the 18 first principal components of the texture_PCA database (thus by keeping only the 18 first attributes of these databases before to apply the DFA preprocessing) in order to build the texture_DFA.dat.Z database file, having 10 dimensions (the texture database having 11 classes). In the case of the texture database, experiments shown that a DFA preprocessing is very useful and most of the time improved the classifiers performances.

This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute ""first date"" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests. The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.

**Primate Splice-Junction Gene Sequences (DNA)**  
Originally from the StatLog project. The raw data is still available on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+(Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences)).

The data consists of 3,186 data points (splice junctions). The data points are described by 180 indicator binary variables and the problem is to recognize the 3 classes (ei, ie, neither), i.e., the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). The StatLog DNA dataset is a processed version of the [Irvine database]((https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+(Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences))). The main difference is that the symbolic variables representing the nucleotides (only A,G,T,C) were replaced by 3 binary indicator variables. Thus the original 60 symbolic attributes were changed into 180 binary attributes. The names of the examples were removed. The examples with ambiguities were removed (there was very few of them, 4). The StatLog version of this dataset was produced by Ross King at Strathclyde University. For original details see the Irvine database documentation.

The nucleotides A,C,G,T were given indicator values as follows:
A -> 1 0 0
C -> 0 1 0
G -> 0 0 1
T -> 0 0 0

Hint: Much better performance is generally observed if attributes closest to the junction are used. In the StatLog version, this means using attributes A61 to A120 only.","0.37551020408163266","1.479795160554579","0.05681104833647207","68.4252660678462","51.914626490897675","1654.0","0.9999954518641249","nan","nan","0.3836322812069","3.0","nan","nan","0.806063119106517","nan","nan","0.021626443645645557","36.27210688516585","2.005524861878453","nan","nan","0.5809082509511699","nan","nan","1.94477877e-06","2.0","nan","nan","24.01129943502825","765.0","180.0","3.0","181.0","3186.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","181.0","99.4475138121547","0.0","0.0","0.0","100.0","0.7666079548971201","nan","nan","0.0019807880110900003","nan","nan","0.8080280988873699","nan","nan","0.0051585759646299995","nan","nan","0.847932858515394","nan","nan","0.0160557352532625","nan","nan","0.07432941462471664"

**CIFAR-10** is a labeled subset of the [80 million tiny images dataset](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/TinyImages/). It (originally) consists 32x32 color images representing 10 classes of objects:  
0. airplane  
1. automobile          
2. bird          
3. cat          
4. deer          
5. dog          
6. frog          
7. horse          
8. ship          
9. truck          

CIFAR-10 contains 6000 images per class. The original train-test split randomly divided these into 5000 train and 1000 test images per class.

The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. ""Automobile"" includes sedans, SUVs, things of that sort. ""Truck"" includes only big trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.

### Attribute description  

Each instance represents a 32x32 colour image as a 3072-value array. The first 1024 entries contain the red channel values, the next 1024 the green, and the final 1024 the blue. The image is stored in row-major order, so that the first 32 entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image.

The labels are encoded as integers in the range 0-9, corresponding to the numbered classes listed above.","0.0986516441940699","3.321928094887362","0.05121666666666667","nan","10.0","6000.0","nan","-0.3916993062151537","140.55893333333302","nan","10.0","0.5522811186855636","80.39663857171094","nan","-0.7583784658177144","120.84449672851565","nan","nan","10.0","0.20190485126859392","63.290201890562464","nan","-1.3247857118006499","99.97718333333357","nan","10.0","-0.07885944658291985","57.46430398342458","10.0","6000.0","0.0","10.0","3073.0","60000.0","0.0","0.0","3072.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","99.96745850959974","0.03254149040026033","nan","-0.8463004771452483","114.15132083333367","nan","0.0921962682494872","60.02352011592343","nan","-0.7309628357059785","121.73080000000027","nan","0.1662982798773079","61.54224833294053","nan","-0.6458422900492707","127.95783749999985","nan","0.26224955925555854","65.19082684651713","0.0"

Expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear conditioning, a task used to assess associative learning.

The data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex. There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a total of 72 mice. In the experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, and for trisomic mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080 measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independent sample/mouse. 

The eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype, behavior and treatment. According to genotype, mice can be control or trisomic. According to behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some mice have been injected with the drug and others have not. 

Classes: 
```
* c-CS-s: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) 
* c-CS-m: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) 
* c-SC-s: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) 
* c-SC-m: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) 
* t-CS-s: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (7 mice) 
* t-CS-m: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice) 
* t-SC-s: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) 
* t-SC-m: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice) 
```

The aim is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between the classes.

**Car Evaluation Database**  
This database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).

The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:
 
    CAR                      car acceptability
    . PRICE                  overall price
    . . buying               buying price
    . . maint                price of the maintenance
    . TECH                   technical characteristics
    . . COMFORT              comfort
    . . . doors              number of doors
    . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
    . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
    . . safety               estimated safety of the car
 
Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for
these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).
 
The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety. Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

**Multiple Features Dataset: Pixel**  
One of a set of 6 datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (0 - 9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. The maps were scanned in 8 bit grey value at density of 400dpi, scanned, sharpened, and thresholded. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. 200 instances per class (for a total of 2,000 instances) have been digitized in binary images.  

Using this dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained (15 x 16 pixels).  

### Attribute Information  

__Only change w.r.t. version 1: variable format transformed to numeric.__

### Data Set Information:  

This data set contains some training and testing data from a remote sensing study by Johnson et al. (2013) that involved detecting diseased trees in Quickbird imagery. There are few training samples for the 'diseased trees' class (74) and many for 'other land cover' class (4265). 

The data set consists of image segments, generated by segmenting the pansharpened image. The segments contain spectral information from the Quickbird multispectral image bands and texture information from the panchromatic (Pan) image band. The testing data set is for the row with â€œSegmentation scale 15â€ segments and â€œoriginal multi-spectral imageâ€ Spectral information in Table 2 of the reference (i.e. row 5). Please see the reference below for more information on the data set, and please cite the reference if you use this data set. Enjoy! 

### Attribute Information:

class: 'w' (diseased trees), 'n' (all other land cover)   
GLCM_Pan: GLCM mean texture (Pan band)   
Mean_G: Mean green value   
Mean_R: Mean red value

__Major changes w.r.t. version 1: changed binary features to data type factor.__

Dataset from the Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge (http://www.agnostic.inf.ethz.ch), which consisted of 5 different datasets (SYLVA, GINA, NOVA, HIVA, ADA). The purpose of the challenge was to check if the performance of domain-specific feature engineering (prior knowledge) can be met by algorithms that were trained on data without any domain-specific knowledge (agnostic). For the latter, the data was anonymised and preprocessed in a way that makes them uninterpretable. 

This dataset contains the agnostic (smashed) version of a data set from the Remote Sensing and GIS Program of Colorado State University for the time span June 2005 - September 2006. A Similar, raw and not-agnostic data set is termed __Covertype Dataset__ and can be found in the [UCI Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype).

Modified by TunedIT (converted to ARFF format)



### Topic

The task of SYLVA is to classify forest cover types. The forest cover type for 30 x 30
meter cells is obtained from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information
System &#40;RIS&#41; data. We brought it back to a two-class classification problem (classifying
Ponderosa pine vs. everything else). The “agnostic data” consists in 216 input variables.
Each pattern is composed of 4 records: 2 true records matching the target and 2 records
picked at random. Thus ½ of the features are distracters. The “prior knowledge data” is
identical to the “agnostic data”, except that the distracters are removed and the identity of
the features is revealed.

For the latter, the data was anonymised and preprocessed in a way that makes them uninterpretable. 

This dataset contains the agnostic (smashed) version of a data set from the US census bureau for the time span June 2005 - September 2006. Similar data set on OpenML is called __adult__. The raw data from the census bureau is also known as the Adult database in the UCI machine-learning repository. 

### Topic

The task of ADA is to discover high revenue people from census data. This is a two-class
classification problem. The raw data from the census bureau is known as the Adult
database in the UCI machine-learning repository. It contains continuous, binary and
categorical variables. The “prior knowledge track” has access to the original features and
their identity. The agnostic track has access to a preprocessed numeric representation
eliminating categorical variables.

### Preprocessing

In [this documentation](http://clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/agnostic/Dataset.pdf) the organisers of the challenge describe the steps they performed to come up with the __agnostic__ data. The 14 original attributes (features) include age, workclass,  education,
marital status, occupation, native country, etc. It contains continuous, binary and categorical features. This dataset is from the ""agnostic learning track"", i.e. has access to a preprocessed numeric representation eliminating categorical variables, but the identity of the features is not revealed. Furthermore, features are scrambled and cannot be linked to the features given in the dataset documentation.

This data was constructed using LLNL's UQ Pipeline, was created under the auspices of the US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344, was funded by LLNL's Uncertainty Quantification Strategic Initiative Laboratory Directed Research and Development Project under tracking code 10-SI-013, and is released under UCRL number LLNL-MISC-633994.


### Data Set Information

This dataset contains records of simulation crashes encountered during climate model uncertainty quantification (UQ) ensembles. Ensemble members were constructed using a Latin hypercube method in LLNL's UQ Pipeline software system to sample the uncertainties of 18 model parameters within the Parallel Ocean Program (POP2) component of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4). Three separate Latin hypercube ensembles were conducted, each containing 180 ensemble members. 46 out of the 540 simulations failed for numerical reasons at combinations of parameter values. The goal is to use classification to predict simulation outcomes (fail or succeed) from input parameter values, and to use sensitivity analysis and feature selection to determine the causes of simulation crashes. Further details about the data and methods are given in the publication 'Failure Analysis of Parameter-Induced Simulation Crashes in Climate Models,' Geoscientific Model Development [(Web Link)](doi:10.5194/gmdd-6-585-2013).


### Attribute Information

The goal is to predict climate model simulation outcomes (column 19, fail or succeed) given scaled values of climate model input parameters (columns 1-18). 

- Columns 3-20: values of 18 climate model parameters scaled in the interval [0, 1] 

- Column 21: simulation outcome (0 = failure, 1 = success)

"### Description ###

This dataset is part of a collection datasets based on the game ""Jungle Chess"" (a.k.a. Dou Shou Qi). For a description of the rules, please refer to the paper (link attached). The paper also contains a description of various constructed features. As the tablebases are a disjoint set of several tablebases based on which (two) pieces are on the board, we have uploaded all tablebases that have explicit different content:

* Rat vs Rat
* Rat vs Panther
* Rat vs. Lion
* Rat vs. Elephant
* Panther vs. Lion
* Panther vs. Elephant
* Tiger vs. Lion
* Lion vs. Lion
* Lion vs. Elephant
* Elephant vs. Elephant
* Complete (Combination of the above)
* RAW Complete (Combination of the above, containing for both pieces just the rank, file and strength information). This dataset contains a similar classification problem as, e.g., the King and Rook vs. King problem and is suitable for classification tasks. 

(Note that this dataset is one of the above mentioned datasets). Additionally, note that several subproblems are very similar. Having seen a given positions from one of the tablebases arguably gives a lot of information about the outcome of the same position in the other tablebases.

"The goal of this challenge is to expose the research community to real world datasets of interest to 4Paradigm. All datasets are formatted in a uniform way, though the type of data might differ. The data are provided as preprocessed matrices, so that participants can focus on classification, although participants are welcome to use additional feature extraction procedures (as long as they do not violate any rule of the challenge). All problems are binary classification problems and are assessed with the normalized Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric (i.e. 2*AUC-1).
